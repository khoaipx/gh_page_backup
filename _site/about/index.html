		<p>My name is <b>Pham Xuan Khoai</b>, in short <b>Khoai</b> (if you are hard to pronounce my name, you can call me <b>Nolan</b>). 
		I'm from Vietnam. Currently, I am R&amp;D Manager and AI Engineer at TopCV company.</p>
		
		<p>Due to the influence of my first supervisor, <a href="http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/">Dr. Le Hong Phuong</a>, 
		I have a special concern about Natural Language Processing and Data Science. In 4 years after I graduated university, 
		I did research and published 4 papers. They motivated me a lot to follow research path. In 2018, I went to Hong Kong 
		and started Ph.D. life. I was a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://vireo.cs.cityu.edu.hk/">VIREO Lab</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University of Hong Kong</a> 
		under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~cwngo/">Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo</a>. In that time, 
		I learned little bit about Computer Vision. But there are some objective and subjective reasons led me to decide 
		to withdrawal my study.</p>
		
		<p>In 2 years and a half between graduating FPT University and studing at CityU, I worked in some companies. 
		They are both small and big companies in Vietnam. My very first company is a small start-up named Rich Anchor.
		In my memory, it is a happy period in my career. We had a dream to build good recommendation systems for content providers.
		We worked really hard to follow that dream. There were many ideas, and a part was complete. Unfortunately, we got 
		finnacial problems and could not continue to stay together. However, in that period, I learned a lot about programming and 
		how to create a production from my colleagues. My next company is VNG (previously, known as Vina game), an only unicorn start-up in Vietnam. It is 
		one of the biggest internet service company in Vietnam with many famous productions: Zing Me, Zalo, Vo Lam Truyen Ky game, ...
		I worked as a research scientist in R&amp;D team. I learned a little bit about Golang. But, after long time, I am not 
		sure that I can write a complete small program with it. My next and final destination before I went to Hong Kong is Finsify.
		Its name tells a part of it. Finsify is a start-up company in fintech domain. We provide services relevant to personal 
		financial management, bank and account aggregation, and money management solution for business. One of our well-known 
		production is Money Lover. It is a mobile app to help people to manage their money. I built an end-to-end system to classify 
		bank transactions. You can find more details in <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. Besides, it is the first time 
		I became a leader. However, I only managed 2 intern students from 2 well-known universities. They are good and potential students.
		They helped me a lot. And it is very happy when one of them is motivated by me to follow my career path to become a data scientist.</p>
		
		<p>Beside my passion of Machine Learning, I am very interested to algorithms. When I studied at FPT University, 
		I paticipated some programming contests for students, both international and national. I also got some achievements. 
		<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/ICPCID/3VU75UUPUV23">Here</a> is my ICPC profile.</p>
		
		<p>That is a short introduction about me. If you have anything you'd like to talk, please feel free to
